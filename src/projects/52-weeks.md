# 52 Weeks — Weekly Personal Project

Overview
- One curated, finished image per week for 52 weeks.
- Aim: build discipline, experiment with styles/techniques, and create a cohesive body of work.

Structure
- Weekly theme (optional) — e.g., "Reflections", "Doors", "Golden Hour", "Minimal", "Motion".
- Deliverables each week:
  - One hero image (final, edited)
  - Short caption (what/where/why)
  - Technical notes (camera, lens, exposure)

Shot checklist (per week)
- Scout 1–2 locations ahead of time
- Compose 10–20 candidate frames
- Select 1 final image and perform basic editing (crop, color, contrast)
- Export web-size and high-res for prints

Metadata & presentation
- Add a one-line caption and include camera settings in project metadata
- Create a monthly highlights page (4–6 images)
- After 12 weeks, produce a "quarter review" gallery

Publishing
- Weekly social post (Instagram / X) with 1–2 images and short note
- Maintain a project page at `/projects/52-weeks` linking to each week's image (use existing `ProjectPage` component)

Tips
- Batch edit weekly to save time.
- Keep a short log of lesson learned and what to try next week.

Sample weekly theme ideas
- Week 1: Portraits (close-up)
- Week 2: Motion blur
- Week 3: Street shadow patterns
- Week 4: Reflections
- Week 5: Tiny details (macro)

Quick next steps I can do for you
- Create a project page template and wiring in `src/data/images.json` so each week's image can be added easily.
- Generate a simple weekly schedule file `src/projects/52-weeks-schedule.json` to track image URIs and captions.
