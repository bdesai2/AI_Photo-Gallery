# Environmental & Conservation Series

Overview
- Visual stories focused on habitat restoration, species recovery, community conservation efforts, and environmental threats.
- Aim: create images that inform, engage, and help partner organizations tell their story.

Project goals

- Photograph volunteers, fieldwork action, and species of interest
- Produce captioned narratives and data-backed context (where possible)

Shot list
- Establishing/hero landscape shot (wide)
- Action shots of volunteers/field crews
- Detail shots: hands, tools, flora/fauna
- Before/after comparison frames
- Portraits of key people (with short quotes)

Permissions & ethics
- Obtain location permits if required
- Obtain model releases for identifiable people
- Avoid disturbing wildlife — follow local guidelines

Deliverables
- Project page with hero image, 8–16 curated photos, captions, and suggested next actions
- Short editorial write-up for NGO partners
- Optional short video clips (30–60s) for social

Outreach & partners
- Local conservation NGOs and land trusts
- City/county parks departments
- University environmental science departments

Presentation ideas
- Create a narrative gallery with captions and links to partner pages
- Offer prints or fundraisers where proceeds support the project

Quick next steps I can do for you
- Add a sample gallery stub in `src/data/images.json` (already added) and create `src/projects/environmental-checklist.md` with upload and caption templates.
- Draft a one-page outreach email template to send to potential partners.

Which next step would you like me to take? I can scaffold the project page and add a checklist and outreach template now.
